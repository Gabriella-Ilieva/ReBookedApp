# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This web application is made for educational purpose.

The goal of the project is to create a community-driven platform that empowers individuals to make a positive impact through the sale and donation of used books. I believe in the transformative power of knowledge and aim to harness it for the greater good. By connecting book lovers with meaningful causes, I strive to build a world where every book sale contributes to positive change.

My vision is a world where the love for books becomes a catalyst for social change. I envision a global community where individuals can easily share, sell, or gift their beloved books, knowing that each transaction supports a cause they are passionate about. Through this collective effort, we aspire to foster a culture of generosity, sustainability, and lifelong learning.

App Values:
* Community Empowerment: Fostering a sense of community where every book has the power to make a difference.

* Sustainability: Promoting the eco-friendly practice of recycling books to reduce waste and carbon footprint.

* Transparency: Ensuring openness and clarity in our operations, so users can trust that their contributions are making a meaningful impact.

* Inclusivity: Building a diverse and inclusive platform that welcomes individuals from all walks of life.

* Social Impact: Channeling the proceeds from book sales to support causes that address pressing social and environmental challenges."
